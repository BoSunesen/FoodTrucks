# Food Trucks
A minimal front-end for my points of interest back-end server.

###Goal of this project
Display a map of food trucks in San Francisco, with optional filtering
by opening hours and by distance to a location. It was not designed to win
any awards, but as a proof of concept presenting the options in the back-end.

###My experience with the technologies used
I have some experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery
and Bootstrap. It is not really my area of expertise though.
